# watchman-amazonlinux-problems

My experiences trying to install `watchman` on Amazonlinux-2. Not very pleasant. The whole story has been reported here:
- https://github.com/facebook/watchman/issues/1135

This repo has:
- a `Dockerfile` with my various experiments,
- a small test script to check that `watchman` works,
- and a working `watchman` binary.
That binary is the only one I could find on the internet that works on Amazonlinux. It by now has vanished from its original location.
I have no idea where it came from, and how it was built.
